kopete-gg-export - a Kopete to standard (text) Gadu-Gadu list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      format converter

Kopete, by default, provides a faulty method of exporting Gadu-Gadu
contact list, namely, you don't see the correct display names when
using metacontacts. If it's your concern, you can use my quick and
dirty script to extract them in the correct way.

Known bugs / limitations:
